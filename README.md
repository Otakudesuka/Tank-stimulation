# Tank-stimulation


It is stimulation which implements the apllication of the shortest path algorithm. A tank is trained such that it reaches its desired destination viva the shortest path. Also each path or the node is assigned some cost value in the code. 

As following the algorithm, the tank tries to reach its final place by acquiring the minimum cost possible and the shortest distancepossible.

To run this stimulation :
