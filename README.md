# Tank-stimulation


It is a stimulation which implements the application of the shortest path algorithm. A tank is trained such that it reaches its desired destination viva the shortest path. Also each path or the node is assigned some cost value in the code. 

As following the algorithm, the tank tries to reach its final place by acquiring the minimum cost possible and the shortest distance possible. We can set as many nodes as we desire for the tank to follow in the code.

To run this stimulation : 

1. Download the zip folder
2. Extract all the files inside it.
3. Run theshortest path tank stimulation.exe
4. Enjoy the stimulation.
